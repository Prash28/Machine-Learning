I got the idea and directions for this project from Youtube(Tech with Tim).

In this project, I got opensource student dataset from internet, created a linear regression model with best possible accuracy from 30 iterations. 
Stored the model using pickle, loaded it back to program to predict on x_test data.
Additionaly, user can input known values(grade 1, grade 2, study time, failures and absences) for the model to predict the target value i.e G3, the final exam score. 

PS: This was my first proper ML program in which I knew what I was doing with the data and the model the whole time. 
    So, I did the "get user input and predict" part myself :)
